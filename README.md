Map to the Future!
=================

###Final project

Map to the Future is a map displaying historical events, with a slider that allows to change the current date.

Each historical event is represented by a marker, and can be clicked to display a pop up providing additional information and links about the event.

The website allows to upload your own historical events.

####Technologies Used

- Ruby
- Sinatra

####My contribution
- I researched similar projects and map tools we could use
- I set up the postgres database allowing to link events between them (using datamapper)
- I styled the pop ups in CSS
- I built a mail-merge system that allowed us to use volunteers to input large amounts of data at the last minute
- I kept the Kanban board always up-to-date
- I prepared the keynote presentation
- During our retro I suggested a widely successful morning hug ritual!
