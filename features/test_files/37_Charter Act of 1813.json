        "short_description" : "The East India Company Act 1813, also known as the Charter Act of 1813, was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which renewed the charter issued to the British East India Company, and continued the Company's rule in India.",
        "description" : "However, the Company's commercial monopoly was ended, except for the tea trade and the trade with China. Reflecting the growth of British power in India, a) the act expressly asserted the Crown's sovereignty over British India, b) it alloted Rs 100,000 to promote education in India, c) Christian missionaries were allowed to come to British India and preach their religion. The power of the provincial governments and courts in India over European British subjects was also strengthened by the Act. Financial provision was also made to encourage a revival in Indian literature and for the promotion of science. The Company's charter had previously been renewed by the Charter Act of 1793, and was next renewed by the Government of India Act 1833. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
